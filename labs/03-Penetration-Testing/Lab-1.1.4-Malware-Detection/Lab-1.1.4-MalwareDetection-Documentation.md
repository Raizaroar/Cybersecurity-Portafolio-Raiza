# Project Overview

Introduction to fundamental malware detection techniques using cryptographic hashing and VirusTotal threat intelligence platform. This lab demonstrates professional methodology for identifying malicious files WITHOUT execution, a critical skill for SOC analysts responding to potential malware incidents.

**Real-World Application:**  

Every day, SOC analysts receive alerts about suspicious files. The first step is NEVER to execute the file, but to generate its hash and query threat intelligence databases. This lab teaches that exact workflow.
