# Lab 01– Splunk VPN Log Analysis (Basics)

## Overview

This lab analyzes VPN logs in Splunk to surface behaviors a SOC analyst cares about: remote access volume, who is most active, where connections originate, and whether there are stability or misuse indicators.  
Events live in **`index="main"`** and are **JSON-formatted**, so I use **`spath`** to extract fields (like `UserName`, `Source_ip`, `Source_Country`, `source_state`, `protocol`, `port`, `action`) before aggregating with `stats`

---

## Goals

- Build baselines: activity by **action**, **user**, **country**, and **state**.  
- Narrow to distinct slices (e.g., **tcp/443 teardowns**) to drive different event counts and investigative pivots.  
- Produce results that are immediately useful for triage and reporting.

---

## Dataset & Commands (what they are and why I use them)

- **`index="main"`** → The logical bucket that stores these VPN events. If you search the wrong index, you’ll return 0 results.  
- **`spath`** → Parses JSON so nested fields (e.g., `Source_Country`, `UserName`) become searchable/reportable.  
- **`stats`** → Aggregates records (e.g., `count by UserName`) to summarize and rank activity.  
- **`search`** → Filters results with conditions (e.g., `action=teardown`).  
- **`sort`** → Orders output for readability (`sort - count` = highest first).  
- **`table`** → Shows selected columns for quick sanity checks.

---

## Query 1 — Events by User and Country

**What I’m searching for**  
Events grouped by `UserName` and `Source_Country`, showing the number of times a user generated traffic from different countries.  

### SPL 1

```spl
index="main" 
| spath 
| search Source_Country!="France" 
| stats count by UserName, Source_Country 
| sort - count
```

*Figure 1: This screenshot shows a Splunk query grouping events by **UserName** and **Source_Country**, excluding traffic from France. The results highlight geolocation activity, allowing detection of unusual login patterns such as a single user appearing in multiple foreign countries. Useful for identifying account compromise or suspicious travel-related anomalies.*

**Good for**  

- Detecting unusual geolocation behavior (e.g., a user logging in from multiple foreign countries).  
- Identifying potential account compromise or travel-related anomalies.  

**Field breakdown**  

- `index="main"` → Points Splunk to the correct dataset.  
- `spath` → Ensures JSON fields are parsed for querying.  
- `UserName` → Identifies the account.  
- `Source_Country` → Captures geolocation metadata.  
- `stats count` → Aggregates how many events match.  
- `sort - count` → Displays most frequent results at the top.

## Query 2 — Failed Login Attempts by User

**What I’m searching for**  
Events where `action=failed`, aggregated by user and IP.

### SPL 2

```spl
index="main" action=failed
| spath
| stats count by UserName, Source_ip
| sort - count
```

![Análisis de Splunk](../../../assets/screenshots/04-SIEM-Projects/Splunk/Lab-01/04-SIEM-Projects-splunk-figure02.png)

*Figure 2: This screenshot shows a Splunk search that has been filtered to display events where action=failed. Events are aggregated by 'UserName' and 'Source_IP', enabling repeated login failures tied to specific accounts and source IPs to be identified. This is a common use case for identifying brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.*

**Good for**  

- Investigating brute force attempts or repeated login failures.
- Correlating failed attempts with possible attacker IP addresses.  

**Field breakdown**  

- `index="main"` → Points Splunk to the correct dataset.  
- `spath` → Ensures JSON fields are parsed for querying.  
- `UserName` → Identifies the account.  
- `action=failed` → Filters only failed authentication attempts.
- `UserName` → Reveals which account is being targeted.  
- `Source_ip` → Identifies the attacker or misconfigured client.

## Query 3 — Event Count by State (USA only)

**What I’m searching for**  
Events originating only from the `United States`, grouped by `source_state`.

### SPL 3

```spl
index="main" Source_Country="United States"
| spath
| stats count by source_state
| sort - count
```

![Análisis de Splunk](../../../assets/screenshots/04-SIEM-Projects/Splunk/Lab-01/04-SIEM-Projects-splunk-figure.03.png)

*Figure 3: This screenshot shows a Splunk query filtered by 'Source_Country = United States', with the results grouped by 'Source_State'. The output provides insight into the geographic distribution of traffic across US states. This information is useful for baseline monitoring and for identifying anomalies (e.g. a user accessing the system from a state outside the expected regions).*

**Good for**  

- Spotting regional anomalies within the same country.
- Useful for organizations that expect traffic only from certain states.  

**Field breakdown**  

- `index="main"` → Points Splunk to the correct dataset.  
- `spath` → Ensures JSON fields are parsed for querying.  
- `Source_Country="United States"` → Filters for U.S. traffic only.  
- `source_state` → Provides geographic detail within the country.
- `stats count` → Counts activity per state.

## Query 4 — TCP Teardown Traffic on Port 443

**What I’m searching for**  
Events where action is `teardown`, using `protocol=tcp`, focusing on `port=443` or any destination port equal to 443.

### SPL 4

```spl
index="main" action=teardown protocol=tcp (port=443 OR dest_port=443)
| spath
| stats count by Source_ip
| sort - count
```

![Análisis de Splunk](../../../assets/screenshots/04-SIEM-Projects/Splunk/Lab-01/04-SIEM-Projects-splunk-figure.04.png)

*Figure 4: This screenshot illustrates a search that filters for 'action=teardown' and the TCP protocol with ports 443 or a destination port of 443. Grouping by Source_IP reveals which IP addresses are generating SSL/TLS session terminations. This information is useful for monitoring secure traffic patterns, diagnosing abnormal HTTPS teardown activity and identifying potential misuse of encrypted connections.*

**Good for**  

- Identifying terminated HTTPS sessions (potential exfiltration or scanning).
- Correlating which IPs are repeatedly generating teardown events.

**Field breakdown**  

- `index="main"` → Points Splunk to the correct dataset.  
- `spath` → Ensures JSON fields are parsed for querying.  
- `action=teardown` → Sessions that were closed.
- `protocol=443 OR dest_port=443` → Narrows down to HTTPS traffic.
- `Source_ip` → The origin of the session.

---

## Query 5 — Event Volume by Outcome (Action)

**What I’m searching for**  
The distribution of session outcomes (e.g., `teardown`, `accept).

### SPL 5

```spl
index="main"
| spath
| stats count by action
| sort - count
```

![Análisis de Splunk](../../../assets/screenshots/04-SIEM-Projects/Splunk/Lab-01/04-SIEM-projects-splunk-figure.05.png)

*Figure 5: This screenshot shows a baseline aggregation query using the 'stats count by Source_ip' function, with the results sorted in descending order. It highlights the IP addresses that generate the most events in the dataset. This is useful for quickly identifying “noisy” IP addresses, scanning activity or determining the most active elements in the environment.*

**Good for**  

- Establishing a baseline of normal network activity.
- Identifying spikes in unusual outcomes (e.g., too many `failed` events).

**Field breakdown**  

- `index="main"` → Points Splunk to the correct dataset.  
- `spath` → Ensures JSON fields are parsed for querying.
- `action` → The outcome of a session (accepted, failed, teardown, etc.).
- `stats count by action` → Quickly counts how many of each outcome exist.

---

## Summary

- `index` ensures Splunk queries the correct dataset.
- `spath` parses JSON data into searchabVe fields.
- `stats` performs aggregations to summarize raw data.
- **Filtering fields** like `UserName`, `Source_ip`, `Source_Country`, and `action` allow analysts to pinpoint anomalies.

These foundational queries are starting points for SOC investigations and can be adapted to different detection use cases, such as brute force detection, suspicious geolocation, HTTPS traffic analysis, and baseline outcome tracking.
