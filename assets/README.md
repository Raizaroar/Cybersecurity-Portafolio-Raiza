#  Assets Directory

##  Overview

This folder serves as a centralized location for storing all visual assets related to my Cybersecurity Portfolio. It includes images, diagrams, screenshots, and other graphical resources used across labs, documentation, and presentations.

##  Purpose

Organizing visual content in one place ensures consistency, easy access, and better version control throughout my SOC Analyst learning journey.

## Contents

- `images/` – General illustrations and diagrams
- `screenshots/` – Captures from labs and tools
- `.gitkeep` – Keeps empty folders tracked in Git
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 🛠️ Usage

All visual assets referenced in markdown files or reports will be stored here. Each file will be named and categorized for clarity and reuse.

> Example: `images/siem_alert.png` – Used in lab02 documentation to illustrate alert correlation.

Feel free to explore the contents and follow updates as I progress through my cybersecurity training.
